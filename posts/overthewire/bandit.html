                <h3>Level 0</h3>
                <p>
                    Level 0 is just the initial setting up of the connection of the game.
                    The process for me involved installing VM softare to run a Linux
                    machine off of as Windows requires a more complicated process to
                    run these games smoothly. I will discuss setting up a VM machine
                    in another post. Once logged into the Linux machine, pop open the
                    console. Then you simply type in:<br>
                    ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220<br>
                    This uses the secure shell connection type with the username
                    <b>bandit0</b> on the host <b>@bandit.labs.overthewire.org</b> using
                    the port <b>-p 2220</b>. The common port for secure shell (SSH) is 22
                    but for this lab 2220 is used instead. This will prompt for the password
                    to be input which is given in the challenge.<br>

                <h3>Level 0-1</h3>
                <p>
                    To find the password to the next level there is a file that contains
                    the file on the user you connected as. The file is contained in a file
                    named <b>readme</b>. The process of reading the content of the file
                    uses the command:<br>
                    cat readme<br>
                    This reveals the password in the console. Write down the password and
                    use it with the process used in the previous level to login to 
                    <b>Bandit1</b>. Be sure to change the number in the login to 1.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 1-2</h3>
                <p>
                    The first few levels follow a pattern of simply using the <b>ls -a</b> command to see files in the current directory. There 
                    is a file named <b>-</b>. This can be read with cat but needs to be edited to <b>cat ./-</b> as it will not read using the
                    normal cat command. 
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 2-3</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the previous level start with <b>ls -a</b>. This one shows a file named
                    <b>spaces in filename</b>. The cat command cannot read the file when typed as written as this is interpretted as different items after each
                    space. The file can be read by setting it between parenthesis like, <b>"spaces in filename"</b>.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 3-4</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the process of using <b>ls -a</b>, a file name <b>.hidden</b>. To read this file, use <b>cat ./.hidden</b> and go on to the next level.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 4-5</h3>
                <p>
                    This level contains a directory called <b>inhere</b>. Using the command, <b>cd inhere</b> allows you to change the current directory to inhere.
                    Inside this directory is a list of files that can possible contain the password. The cat command can be used to read through the files till 
                    the password is found.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 5-6</h3>
                <p>
                    This level follows the same as before but we are given the hint that the file size is 1033 bytes. Once inside the inhere directory, we can 
                    use the find command like so <b>find -size 1033c</b>. This gives us one file that can be read for the password.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 6-7</h3>
                <p>
                    The password is found somewhere on the server with a file size of 33 bytes, user of bandit7, and group of bandit6. The find command comes 
                    in handy here as the command <b>find -user bandit7 -group bandit6</b> will list all files with these conditions. The file seems to be in 
                    <b>/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password</b>
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 7-8</h3>
                <p>
                    There is a large data found within the current directory with the password next to the word millionth. The next new command to be used is 
                    grep. This allows you to find something that matches the pattern put into the command. Using the command, 
                    <b>cat data.txt | grep millionth</b>. The | in-between the two commands takes the output of the cat command and feed it into the grep
                    command so it can search through it for the password.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 8-9</h3>
                <p>
                    The current directory holds a data file with a lot of possible passwords. The correct password is the only unique one. We will introduce two new 
                    ones of <b>sort</b> and <b>uniq</b>. We can combine the two with <b>sort -h data.txt | uniq -u</b>. This sorts the passwords to combine similar ones 
                    together and the uniq command search for any line that has no repeats.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 9-10</h3>
                <p>
                    The file in the current directory has the password as the only human-readable line with multiple = signs next to it. The command 
                    <b>strings data.txt | grep ==</b> can be used to first list all readable text within the file and then find the line with multiple 
                    = signs next to it.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 10-11</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first file that has been encoded to hide the password. The encryption method is base64 which can be undone with 
                    <b>base64 -d data.txt | cat</b>. This will decrypt it and readout the password within.
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 11-12</h3>
                <p>
                    For this level, the file containing the password has its letters rotated 13 places. This is a common cryptographic method.
                    The file can be read with cat and translated with the tr command like <b>cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'</b>
                </p><br><hr><br>
                <h3>Level 12-13</h3>
                <p>
                    This level requires quite a few steps. The file has been compressed multiple times and turned into a hexdump. This introduces 
                    multiple new commands that are: xxd, gzip, tar, and bzip2. Looking at the data file sees a hexdump as the output. The command
                    <b>xxd -r file > new_filename</b>. The ls -l command will show what type of  
                </p><br><hr><br>
