                <h1>Pong</h1>
                <p>
                    I will start off by saying I have run through making this game twice as I started this challenge a few weeks ago and restarted for now the third time.
                    I made it through a few games with a couple different versions for a couple.<br><br>
                    Pong was made in 1972 with the premise of two paddles bouncing a ball back and forth to score goals on the other side. The paddle move on one axis to 
                    stop the ball from moving past them. The first time I ran through this, I got held up on learning the Godot engine and how the GDscript actually works.
                    I did not have much programming experience and relied on looking up tidbits of code for various aspects of the game. It was rough but I completed the
                    overall gameplay. The second iteration included many improvements such as main menus, winning screens, two player options, and power-ups for the ball
                    if they moved over the randomly spawning power-up orbs. For the third iteration of making Pong, I will look to clean up the code on my previous attemps
                    as well as making it look cleaner and adding power-ups. The previous power-ups included speed up, slow down, increase size, shrink size, and change color.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    The first steps I do to set up the game is to create two static bodies for the walls on the sides of the playing area. The next step is creating two
                    character bodies for which the player and computer will use to move ad play. The final step is to create a bouncy ball that will move in a direction until
                    it collides with something. There you go, you have made pong...somewhat. There is quite a bit of code for each instance to work correctly but the 
                    Godot system is not too difficult to get a handle of.
